<P>
Starting from version 4.4.1, QLC+ offers a functionality called fixtures remapping.<br>
When performing live shows in different places, it occurs to know which 
<A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">fixtures</A> are
installed at the very last minute. Well, fixtures remapping helps you to use your
existing projects in every situation.<br>
For example, you can setup a project with just one PAR, one moving head and one scanner.
When reaching the place where the show is going to take place, you can remap your fixtures
to those you find, for example 50 PARs, 30 moving heads and 15 scanners.<br>
With QLC+, it will take just a few minutes to do this operation !<br>
<br>
Fixtures remapping allows to perform 1-to-1 or 1-to-many reassignment of entire fixtures or single channels.
QLC+ will try as much as possible to reassign channels of the same category.<br>
When confirming the operation, a new project will be automatically saved to preserve your original project.<br>
All the fixtures, scenes, EFX, Virtual Console widgets and audio triggers found in the original project
will be remapped to work on a new fixtures list.<br>

<h2>Remapping window</h2>
<p>
Let's now explain how to use the fixture remapping window, starting from a screenshot of
a complete example:<br><br>
<A HREF="file:fixremap.png"><IMG SRC="fixremap.png"></A>
<br><br>
Following, a detailed explanation of each element of the remapping window.<br>
<br>
<TABLE BORDER="1">
 <TR>
  <TD><b>Source fixtures</b></TD>
  <TD>On the left side of the window, there's a tree representing the universes, fixtures and channels
    used on your project. This list cannot be changed at this stage.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><b>Remapped fixtures</b></TD>
  <TD>On the right side of the window, there's a tree representing the universes, fixtures and channels
    where you're going to remap your source fixtures.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"></TD>
  <TD>Add one or more fixtures to the Remapped fixtures list. Clicking this button will open
    the <A HREF="file:addeditfixtures.html">Add/Edit Fixtures</A> window. Please note that
    once a fixture is added, it cannot be modified, so if you need specific names or quantity,
    remember to do it before adding the new fixtures</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_remove.png"></TD>
  <TD>Remove the selected <A HREF="file:concept.html#Fixtures">Fixture</A> from the remapped fixtures list.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/remap.png"></TD>
  <TD>This is probably the most important button of the window. It allows you to
    determine the connection between a source and a remapped fixture. 
    The connection can be performed either between single channels or on a whole fixture.<br>
    In the first case you will need to select the source channel from the source fixtures list 
    and a target channel from the remapped fixtures list.<br>
    In the second case you will need to select a fixture from the source fixtures list and a 
    target fixture from the remapped fixtures list.<br>
    Wrong selections will popup an error. For example you cannot remap a channel on a fixture and vice-versa.<br>
    If the connection is valid, it will be represented as a line in the white area between the source and the remapped lists.
    </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><IMG SRC="qrc:/fileclose.png"></TD>
  <TD>Remove a previously created remapping connection. Wrong selections will display an error popup.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><b>Remap fixtures names</b></TD>
  <TD>If checked, a new remapping connection between fixtures will also set the target fixture name
  to the source fixture name.</TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD><b>Destination project name</b></TD>
  <TD>The absolute path and name of the remapped project. For convenience, QLC+ will automatically 
  take the original project name and will add "(remapped)" at the end of it.</TD>
 </TR>
