<P>
The DMX address tool is a quite easy/self explanatory functionality of QLC+ introduced in version 4.3.2.<br>
It helps you to quickly calculate your fixtures addresses in a visual way.<br>
A representation of a common 10pin DIP switch is displayed and you can select the background color,
the horizontal and vertical oriantation, to display the DIP exactly how you see it on your fixture.<br><br>

A particular note goes for the 10th pin. Usually it is used to enable/disable the DMX feature of a fixture so,
if your product manual says it has to be raised to enable the DMX control, then remember to do it even if
QLC+ displays it set to OFF.
