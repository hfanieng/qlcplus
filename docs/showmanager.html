<H1>Show Manager</H1>
<P>
The Show Manager has been introduced in QLC+ starting from version 4.0.0, after forking the original
QLC code on November 5th, 2012.<br>
<br>
This new feature is meant to give users the possibility to setup a time driven show in a friendly and
completely graphical way.<br>
The graphic interface shows a multitrack view, typical of audio sequencers or video editing softwares,
and with it users are allowed to place QLC+ <A HREF="concept.html#Functions">Functions</A> at the desired
place and time in the view.<br>
<br>
A typical use case are those gigs where bands play songs following a metronome and the light show has
always to be the same, following the music.<br>
Another case are visual entertainment shows, where dancers or singers follow some music and lights create
the atmosphere at the right time.<br>
<br>
The Show Manager has been studied to be used quickly and easily. Basically with just 4 steps a complete
<A HREF="concept.html#Show">Show</A> can be created:

<OL>
<H3><LI>Add a new Show <IMG SRC="qrc:/show.png"></LI></H3>
First of all you need to add a new Show to the view. This creates an empty multitrack view with no tracks
and no items, ready to be filled.<br>
A popup will appear asking the name to assign to the Show. It is possible to change the name afterward with the
<A HREF="functionmanager.html">Function Manager</A>, using the <A HREF="showeditor.html">Show Editor</A> panel.

<H3><LI>Add a Scene <IMG SRC="qrc:/scene.png"></LI></H3>
In the Show Manager, a Scene corresponds to a track. When you add a Scene, a popup will ask you to select an existing
Scene or to create a new one with a default name.<br>
When done, a new track will be created. All the sequences created on this track
will act only on the associated Scene, not affecting all the other tracks.<br>
A newly created track will be set automatically as active. An active track has a green light on the left side.<br>
A Track can be set to mute and solo states. Mute state will exclude the track from the playback, while the solo state will
mute all the other tracks of the Show.<br>
Once selected, a track will display its <A HREF="sceneeditor.html">Scene Editor</A> on the bottom of the screen.

<H3><LI>Add a Sequence <IMG SRC="qrc:/sequence.png">  or Audio <IMG SRC="qrc:/audio.png"></LI></H3>

When a track has been activated, it is possible to add a <A HREF="concept.html#Sequence">Sequence</A> or
and <A HREF="concept.html#Audio">Audio</A> item to it.<br>
A new item will be placed at the cursor position, but it is always possible to move it to the desired time
just by dragging it along the timeline.<br>
A show item cannot be moved to another track, since it is bounded to the track where it has originally been created.<br>
A show item can be cloned <IMG SRC="qrc:/editcopy.png"> or deleted <IMG SRC="qrc:/editdelete.png"> with the toolbar icons.
The cloned item will be placed at the current cursor position.<br>
The background color can be changed with the toolbar icon <IMG SRC="qrc:/color.png">. The assigned color will be saved
in your project file.<br>
Once selected, a sequence will display its <A HREF="chasereditor.html">Chaser Editor</A> on the right side of the screen.
Follow step 4 to understand how to fill a Sequence<br>

<H3><LI>Add some steps <IMG SRC="qrc:/edit_add.png"></LI></H3>
Once a sequence has been created, it is now the time to add steps to it.<br>
<b>Please note</b> that the difference between a Chaser and a Sequence is that a Sequence is bound to the Track (so the Scene)
where it has been created. So, when adding a step, QLC+ will not ask the Function to associate, but will always use the
channels of the same Scene.<br>
When modifying a step duration, fade in or fade out time, you will see the sequence changing on the multitrack view,
giving an immediate feedback for aligning to other sequences or certain points in time.<br>
Fade In and Fade Out times will be displayed as diagonal lines over the sequence item on the multitrack view, while
different steps will be divided by vertical lines.<br>

</OL>
<br>
To increase the complexity of the Show, more sequences, audio and scenes can be added. Just repeat the above steps
depending on your needs.<br>

<H2>And finally...play ! <IMG SRC="qrc:/player_play.png"></H2>
When a complete show has finally been created, it can be played just by clicking on the Play icon.<br>
At the moment playback starts always from the beginning of a Show and the Stop button will bring the cursor back to 0.<br>
