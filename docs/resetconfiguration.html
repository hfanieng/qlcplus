<H1>Configuration Reset</H1>
<P>
Sometimes it might be necessary to reset QLC+ configuration, and it might be tricky to find the files involved.<br>
Here's a brief HOWTO explaining where to find them in your Operating System and how to bring QLC+ to a "Factory defaults" state.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: please DO NOT edit the configuration files manually unless you know what you're doing. Any misplaced change can cause
program crashes or awkward instability.
</P>

<H2>Linux</H2>
<P>
Configuration files are located in your user $HOME directory, in the .config/qlcplus folder.<br>
Here's the quick command to access it from a terminal:<br>
<code>cd $HOME/.config/qlcplus</code><br>
You will find both QLC+ and Fixture editor configuration files. If you need to reset both just delete them.
</P>

<H2>Windows</H2>
<P>
Configuration parameters are stored in the Windows registry.<br>
To access it, please run the "regedit" tool and search for the key named "qlcplus".<br>
Once found delete the whole key to restore QLC+ to the original installation state.
</P>

<H2>Mac OSX</H2>
<P>
Configuration files are located in your user $HOME directory, in the Library/Preferences folder.<br>
Here's the quick command to access it from a terminal:<br>
<code>cd $HOME/Library/Preferences</code><br>
QLC+ configuration file is called "net.sf.Q Light Controller Plus.plist" while the Fixture editor 
configuration file is called "net.sf.Fixture Definition Editor.plist".<br>
Just remove them with the "rm" command.
</P>
